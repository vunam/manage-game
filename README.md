The requirements for the test project are:
** Write a football online manager game**

You need to write a simple online application where football/soccer fans will create their fantasy teams and will be able to sell or buy players.
User must be able to create an account and log in.
When the user is signed up he should get a team of 20 players (the system should generate players):
  * 3 goalkeepers
  * 6 defenders
  * 6 midfielders
  * 5 attackers
Each player has an initial value of $1.000.000.
Each team has additional $5.000.000 to buy other players.
When logged in, a user can see his team and player information
Team has the following information:
  * Team name and a country (can be edited)
  * Team value (sum of player values)
Player has the following information
  * First name, last name, country (can be edited by a team owner)
  * Age (random number from 18 to 40) and market value 
A team owner can set the player on a transfer list
Each user should be able to see all players on a transfer list and filter them by country, team name, player name, and a value.
Once an owner finds a player he wants to buy, a former team owner should have an info message displayed next time he is logged in. Also, with each transfer, team budgets are updated.

Implement two additional roles
** A league manager which can CRUD teams and modify their roles (an owner can also become a league manager)
** An administrator who can create teams, edit teams, players (add new players to the market or in the team) and change all player/team information, including player’s value

REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication 
In any case, you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly. Please be prepared to use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc. for this purpose.
If it’s a web application, it must be a single-page application. All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable.
Minimal UI/UX design is needed. You will not be marked on graphic design. However, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.
Bonus: unit and e2e tests.
